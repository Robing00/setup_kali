# Kali-Clean

Kali installation with a few extra programms / configurations. 

If you want a clean i3 desktop installation you can take the [install_i3.sh](../blob/main/install_i3.sh) to have it.
All the configs of alacritty and the i3 part is from [xct](https://github.com/xct)

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user. This updates kali and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while.


## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

For i3

```
./install_i3.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).
